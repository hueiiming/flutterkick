## Our Solution:
Our team has developed a Flutter based app as a solution to one of the 17 UN SDGs -- "Reducing Inequalities". Our app, _**MentorMe**_ is directed towards the less fortunate to help them find a willing mentor to guide them to reach their desired career goals.

We would like to thank the various online tutorials and open source code materials which helped us throughout our app-making process. Special thanks to out mentor, Nicholette, who patiently guided us over the last 4 weeks.
